## Web Polyfills

These are various polyfills for various web site projects I have worked on. They were generally created when very specific browsers, or behaviours were expected and no other publicly available polyfill could be used.

### Polyfills
#### simple/RadioNodeList.js
This will polyfill the [RadioNodeList.value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/RadioNodeList) behaviour in Microsoft Edge 14+ (no support for Internet Explorer, all other modern browsers already support it).

Can be used to get and set the value of a group of radio buttons.
